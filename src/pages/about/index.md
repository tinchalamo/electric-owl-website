Electric Owl Creative works hand-in-hand with filmmakers and studios alike to craft captivating visuals geared for today’s content-hungry audiences. The company was forged under the mission that we can do better—that, by combining passion and prowess, we can produce compelling marketing campaigns for films that deserve to be seen.

Founder Greg MacLennan is the former Head of Video and a programmer for the Alamo Drafthouse, where he honed his artistry painstakingly making movie montages that moved people to laughter and tears, while also creating action-packed movie experiences, like CAGED, Denzel Watchingthon, Russellmania, Cruise Control, and The Stallone Zone. With the Drafthouse Films’ purchase of Mood Indigo, Greg jumped at the chance to edit the trailer for Michel Gondry’s heartwarming romance and became the company’s in-house A/V Creative Director. Following his time at Drafthouse Films, Greg worked under Tom Quinn at NEON, also as his A/V Creative Director.  

For Drafthouse Films, Greg worked on the following films: The Invitation, Spring, Roar (indiewire.com’s No. 7 best trailer of 2015), and even The Tribe—where, literally, no one speaks a single word!—amongst others. He also edited the theatrical trailer for The Greasy Strangler for Film Rise (Paste magazine’s No. 9 best trailer of 2016). Upon departing Drafthouse Films for NEON, Greg created materials for Colossal, Bad Batch, Beach Rats, and the Oscar-winning I, Tonya. He’s had the pleasure to work closely with several talented directors, such as Nacho Vigalondo, Ana Lily Amirpour, Craig Gillespie, Joshua Oppenheimer, Michel Gondry, and many others.
